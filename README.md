# PyQt-real-time-scope-in-raspberry-PI-3.

The idea of this project is to develop a low cost scope for home made projects. 

For people that already have a Raspberry PI 3, this Software will allow enabling it as an scope for free. 

For the Hardware part also developing a low cost solution by using low cost microcontroller (MSP430) and low cost terminals (Home made with some resistance). 

**Notes:**

1. This is not intended to be a professional scope however a quick and practical solution for several home made projects.
2. This is a not a final solution and it is just an idea and it is work in progress solution.
